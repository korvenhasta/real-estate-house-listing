# Real Estate House Listing

# What

This is my first Vue.js app, which I developed for learning purposes.
The app enables users to follow various stories:

1. View the list of houses
2. Add a new listing
3. Edit a listing
4. Delete a listing
5. Sort a list of houses
6. Search a house

# How

In this App I used technologies:

- Vue.js
- Vite
- Pinia

There are libraries below which were used in the App:

- axios
- json-server

# Demo

# How to start the App

```sh
npm run dev
```

```sh
npm run api
```

## Vite docs

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
